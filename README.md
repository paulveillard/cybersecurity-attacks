## `What Are Exploits`

Exploit attacks are the ways hackers take advantage of weaknesses or vulnerabilities within systems. 

*For example, take a hammer, a piece of wood, and a nail. The vulnerability is the soft, permeable nature of wood, and the exploit is the act of hammering the nail into the wood.*

> As a cybersecurity professional, you must understand vulnerabilities and exploits to reduce the likelihood of being compromised. In the next section, we will describe risk.
