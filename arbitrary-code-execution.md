## `What Are Exploits`

**An arbitrary code execution (ACE)** stems from a flaw in software or hardware. A hacker spots that problem, and then they can use it to execute commands on a target device.

> Remote code execution vulnerabilities happen when a hacker can launch malignant code across an entire network rather than on one lone device.
