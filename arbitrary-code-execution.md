## `What is Arbitrary Code Execution?`

[**An arbitrary code execution (ACE)**](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/arbitrary-code-execution/) stems from a flaw in software or hardware. A hacker spots that problem, and then they can use it to execute commands on a target device.

> Remote code execution vulnerabilities happen when a hacker can launch malignant code across an entire network rather than on one lone device.

## `How Does Arbitrary Code Execution Work?`
Computers can't differentiate between valid inputs (like a password) and commands (like code). If you tap in the proper sequence of numbers and letters, and the computer is built to accept them, you can transform almost any entry into an attack.

- A hacker could trigger a problem that already exists, modify information within a program, load different code, or install a problem to run later.

- The target software or device controls the level of access a hacker has, but the hackerâ€™s goal is to escalate their privilege. In essence, the hacker tries to achieve administrator control of the device. If they succeed, that computer could become a zombie device for hackers to exploit in another attack.

ACE incidents can vary in their severity.

> In 2014, a gamer used ACE commands and the buttons on a controller to hijack the video game Super Mario World. The exploit was so significant that one writer said, "The fabric of the game's reality comes apart at the seams for a few seconds."

They can have more dramatic consequences than altering a video game, too. Hackers have also used ACE to steal data, run extortion schemes, and otherwise bring a business to its knees. Private text messages and search histories can even be exposed when hackers use ACE.
